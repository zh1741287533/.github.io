Alas, It was to none but me 唉，都只伤害到自己

And all I've done for want of wit 我一生求取智慧

So fill to me the parting glass 就请为我斟上这杯离别酒

Goodnight and joy be to you all! 晚安了各位，愿你们欢喜快乐！

Then gently rise and softly call 然后轻轻站起，柔声的说

Of all the comrades that e'er I had 我所有的好伙伴

They're sorry for my going away 都不舍我离去

And all the sweethearts that e'er I had 我所有亲爱的人

They'd wish me one more day to stay. 都希望我多留一天

Since it fell into my lot 然而命中注定

that I should rise and you should not 我该起身先你们离开

I'll gently rise and softly call 我只好轻轻站起并柔声的说
